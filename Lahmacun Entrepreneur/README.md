# Lahmacun Entrepreneur (A HashMap Project)

In this project, we have lahmacun company and we want to track down the status of the employees. We used a hash table and made operations on employees.

## Operations

- Add: A new employee to add to the given branch at the given position.
- Leave: Remove the given employee from the given branch if possible. If it's not possible some bonus should be given.
- Performance Update: Process the monthly score of the given employee, there may be promotions and bonuses.
- Print Monthly Bonuses: Prints total bonus amount given at the specified branch that month.
- Print Overall Bonuses: Prints total amount of bonus that have given from the start of input file up to now in the specified branch.
- Print Manager: Prints the manager of the specified branch.

## Performance

- All operations execute in O(1) complexity.

I didn't upload the large test cases because they exceeded the 100mb limit of Github. But they execute fairly quick. (around 1 to 4 seconds for extremely large inputs like 1 million lines of input)
